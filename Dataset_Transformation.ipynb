If they were inside the usual physiological values no modification will be required, however it is not the case. For instance, a cholesterol level of 526 or 564 mmHg is not normal even for a human being. On the other, the sex attribute is completely unbalanced, only having 25% of females is detrimental for future uses of the dataset for modelling predictions.\n",
